# Unit V: Principles of Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Principle, Benefits, and Applications of OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concepts of **Objects** and **Classes**. OOP concepts in Python make the code more reusable and easier to work with in larger programs.

### Some Applications of OOP:
- Software Development
- Game Development
- Web Development
- Data Analysis and Machine Learning

An **object** is a self-contained entity that encapsulates data (*data members/attributes/property*) and related operations (*methods/behaviors*) that act on that data.

Think of an object as a real-world entity, like a car or a book. A car object would have attributes like `color` and `model`, and methods like `accelerate`, `brake`, and `turn`.

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that all objects of that class will share. You can think of a class as a factory that produces objects. The class defines the specifications, and each object created from the class is an instance with its own set of data.
