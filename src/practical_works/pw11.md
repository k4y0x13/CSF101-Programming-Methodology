# Practical 11: Object Oriented Programming Basic Class Exercises

## Objective
In this lab, you will work on some Object Oriented Programming exercises. This exercise will help you understand the syntax of creating classes and objects.

**Submission Date:**

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python syntax
- Understanding of lists and functions in Python
- Familiarity with time complexity concepts (optional, but helpful)

## Lab Steps
Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp

### Step 1: Implement Basic Person Class
Add a Person class with a constructor having basic attributes like name and age

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1) 
```

### Step 2: Implement Instance Method
Add Instance Method named hello() to Introduce Name and Age

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def hello(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name + " and my age is " + str(self.age))

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1.hello())
```

### Step 3: Impelement Dunder Str Method
Add \__str__() method to produce a print output when called

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def hello(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name + " and my age is " + str(self.age))

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
```

### Step 4: Implement wealth with getter and setter methods
Change age to a protected variable _age.

Note: Protected: Members are accessible within the class itself and also from derived (inherited) classes. 

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self._age = age

  def hello(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name + " and my age is " + str(self.age))

  @property
  def age(self):
    return self._age

  @age.setter
  def age(self, newAge):
    self._age = newAge

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
print(p1.age)
p1.age = 20
print(p1)
```

### Step 5: Implement a subclass 
Inheriting a Dancer Subclass from Person Class with additional functionality. 

Note that protected variable _age is inheritted together with getter and setter methods.
```python
class Dancer(Person):
  def __init__(self, name, age, genre):
    super().__init__(name, age)
    self.genre = genre

  def dance(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name + " and my favorite dance is " + self.genre)

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age}) does {self.genre}"

d1 = Dancer("John", 36, "cham")
print(d1)
```


## Exercises for Students

1. Implement different classes and subclasses for other types of function classes.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you've implemented an OOP class with some basic functionality.
