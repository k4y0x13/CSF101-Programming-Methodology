### Step 4: Study Pseudo Code
Binary search is a searching algorithm that works only for sorted search space. It repeatedly divides the search space into half by using the fact that the search space is sorted and checking if the desired search result will be found in the left or right half.
Example: Given a sorted array Arr[] and a value X, The task is to find the index at which X is present in Arr[].
Below is the pseudocode for Binary search.

    BinarySearch(ARR, X, LOW, HIGH)
           repeat till LOW = HIGH
                  MID = (LOW + HIGH)/2
                  if (X == ARR[mid])
                      return MID
                  else if (x > ARR[MID]) 
                      LOW = MID + 1
                  else                  
                      HIGH = MID â€“ 1
