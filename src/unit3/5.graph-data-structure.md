# Graph Data Structure

# Graph Data Structures in Python

## 1. Graph Representations

Graphs are fundamental data structures used to represent relationships between entities. In Python, we can represent graphs using two main approaches: adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.

### 1.1 Adjacency Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where rows and columns represent vertices, and the values indicate the presence or absence of edges between vertices.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an adjacency matrix for an undirected graph
num_vertices = 4
adj_matrix = np.zeros((num_vertices, num_vertices), dtype=int)

# Add edges
adj_matrix[0][1] = adj_matrix[1][0] = 1  # Edge between vertex 0 and 1
adj_matrix[1][2] = adj_matrix[2][1] = 1  # Edge between vertex 1 and 2
adj_matrix[2][3] = adj_matrix[3][2] = 1  # Edge between vertex 2 and 3
adj_matrix[3][0] = adj_matrix[0][3] = 1  # Edge between vertex 3 and 0

print("Adjacency Matrix:")
print(adj_matrix)
```

Output:

```
Adjacency Matrix:
[[0 1 0 1]
 [1 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 1]
 [1 0 1 0]]
```

Pros of adjacency matrix:

- Fast edge lookup (O(1) time complexity)
- Easy to implement and understand

Cons of adjacency matrix:

- Uses more space for sparse graphs (O(V^2) space complexity, where V is the number of vertices)
- Slower to add or remove vertices

### 1.2 Adjacency List

An adjacency list represents a graph as a dictionary where keys are vertices, and values are lists of adjacent vertices.

```python
# Create an adjacency list for an undirected graph
adj_list = {
    0: [1, 3],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [1, 3],
    3: [0, 2]
}

print("Adjacency List:")
for vertex, neighbors in adj_list.items():
    print(f"{vertex}: {neighbors}")

# Function to add an edge
def add_edge(graph, vertex1, vertex2):
    graph[vertex1].append(vertex2)
    graph[vertex2].append(vertex1)

# Add a new edge
add_edge(adj_list, 0, 2)

print("\nUpdated Adjacency List:")
for vertex, neighbors in adj_list.items():
    print(f"{vertex}: {neighbors}")
```

Output:

```
Adjacency List:
0: [1, 3]
1: [0, 2]
2: [1, 3]
3: [0, 2]

Updated Adjacency List:
0: [1, 3, 2]
1: [0, 2]
2: [1, 3, 0]
3: [0, 2]
```

Pros of adjacency list:

- Space-efficient for sparse graphs (O(V + E) space complexity, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges)
- Faster to add or remove vertices and edges

Cons of adjacency list:

- Slower edge lookup compared to adjacency matrix (O(degree(v)) time complexity, where degree(v) is the number of neighbors of vertex v)

## 2. Weighted and Unweighted Graphs

Graphs can be either weighted or unweighted. Weighted graphs assign a value (weight) to each edge, while unweighted graphs treat all edges equally.

### 2.1 Unweighted Graph

We've already seen examples of unweighted graphs in the previous section. Here's another example using an adjacency list:

```python
# Unweighted graph using adjacency list
unweighted_graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

# Function to print all edges
def print_edges(graph):
    for vertex, neighbors in graph.items():
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            print(f"{vertex} -- {neighbor}")

print("Edges in the unweighted graph:")
print_edges(unweighted_graph)
```

Output:

```
Edges in the unweighted graph:
A -- B
A -- C
B -- A
B -- D
B -- E
C -- A
C -- F
D -- B
E -- B
E -- F
F -- C
F -- E
```

### 2.2 Weighted Graph

For weighted graphs, we can modify our adjacency list to include weights:

```python
# Weighted graph using adjacency list with tuples (neighbor, weight)
weighted_graph = {
    'A': [('B', 4), ('C', 2)],
    'B': [('A', 4), ('D', 3), ('E', 1)],
    'C': [('A', 2), ('F', 5)],
    'D': [('B', 3)],
    'E': [('B', 1), ('F', 6)],
    'F': [('C', 5), ('E', 6)]
}

# Function to print all edges with weights
def print_weighted_edges(graph):
    for vertex, neighbors in graph.items():
        for neighbor, weight in neighbors:
            print(f"{vertex} --({weight})--> {neighbor}")

print("Edges in the weighted graph:")
print_weighted_edges(weighted_graph)

# Function to find the total weight of the graph
def total_weight(graph):
    total = 0
    visited = set()
    for vertex, neighbors in graph.items():
        for neighbor, weight in neighbors:
            if (vertex, neighbor) not in visited and (neighbor, vertex) not in visited:
                total += weight
                visited.add((vertex, neighbor))
    return total

print(f"\nTotal weight of the graph: {total_weight(weighted_graph)}")
```

Output:

```
Edges in the weighted graph:
A --(4)--> B
A --(2)--> C
B --(4)--> A
B --(3)--> D
B --(1)--> E
C --(2)--> A
C --(5)--> F
D --(3)--> B
E --(1)--> B
E --(6)--> F
F --(5)--> C
F --(6)--> E

Total weight of the graph: 21
```

## 3. Directed and Undirected Graphs

Graphs can be either directed or undirected. In directed graphs, edges have a direction, while in undirected graphs, edges are bidirectional.

### 3.1 Undirected Graph

We've already seen examples of undirected graphs. Here's another example using an adjacency list:

```python
# Undirected graph
undirected_graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 3, 4],
    3: [1, 2, 4],
    4: [2, 3]
}

# Function to check if an edge exists
def has_edge(graph, vertex1, vertex2):
    return vertex2 in graph[vertex1] and vertex1 in graph[vertex2]

# Check for edges
print("Edge (1, 2):", has_edge(undirected_graph, 1, 2))
print("Edge (1, 4):", has_edge(undirected_graph, 1, 4))

# Function to add an edge
def add_undirected_edge(graph, vertex1, vertex2):
    graph[vertex1].append(vertex2)
    graph[vertex2].append(vertex1)

# Add a new edge
add_undirected_edge(undirected_graph, 1, 4)

print("\nUpdated Undirected Graph:")
for vertex, neighbors in undirected_graph.items():
    print(f"{vertex}: {neighbors}")
```

Output:

```
Edge (1, 2): True
Edge (1, 4): False

Updated Undirected Graph:
1: [2, 3, 4]
2: [1, 3, 4]
3: [1, 2, 4]
4: [2, 3, 1]
```

### 3.2 Directed Graph

In a directed graph, edges have a direction, so we only add edges in one direction:

```python
# Directed graph
directed_graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [3],
    3: [4],
    4: []
}

# Function to check if a directed edge exists
def has_directed_edge(graph, from_vertex, to_vertex):
    return to_vertex in graph[from_vertex]

# Check for edges
print("Edge (1 -> 2):", has_directed_edge(directed_graph, 1, 2))
print("Edge (2 -> 1):", has_directed_edge(directed_graph, 2, 1))

# Function to add a directed edge
def add_directed_edge(graph, from_vertex, to_vertex):
    graph[from_vertex].append(to_vertex)

# Add a new directed edge
add_directed_edge(directed_graph, 4, 1)

print("\nUpdated Directed Graph:")
for vertex, neighbors in directed_graph.items():
    print(f"{vertex}: {neighbors}")

# Function to find all paths from start to end
def find_all_paths(graph, start, end, path=[]):
    path = path + [start]
    if start == end:
        return [path]
    if start not in graph:
        return []
    paths = []
    for node in graph[start]:
        if node not in path:
            new_paths = find_all_paths(graph, node, end, path)
            for new_path in new_paths:
                paths.append(new_path)
    return paths

# Find all paths from vertex 1 to 4
all_paths = find_all_paths(directed_graph, 1, 4)
print("\nAll paths from 1 to 4:")
for path in all_paths:
    print(" -> ".join(map(str, path)))
```

Output:

```
Edge (1 -> 2): True
Edge (2 -> 1): False

Updated Directed Graph:
1: [2, 3]
2: [3]
3: [4]
4: [1]

All paths from 1 to 4:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
1 -> 3 -> 4
```

## Summary

In this comprehensive guide to graph data structures in Python, we've covered the following key concepts:

1. Graph representations:

   - Adjacency matrix: A 2D array representation of graphs
   - Adjacency list: A dictionary-based representation of graphs

2. Weighted and unweighted graphs:

   - Unweighted graphs: All edges have equal importance
   - Weighted graphs: Edges have associated weights or costs

3. Directed and undirected graphs:
   - Undirected graphs: Edges have no direction
   - Directed graphs: Edges have a specific direction

Throughout these examples, students have learned:

- How to implement graphs using both adjacency matrices and adjacency lists
- The pros and cons of different graph representations
- How to add edges and check for their existence in various graph types
- Implementing weighted graphs and calculating total graph weight
- Traversing graphs and finding paths between vertices
- Basic graph algorithms like depth-first search (used in the `find_all_paths` function)

These concepts and implementations provide a solid foundation for working with graph data structures in Python and solving various graph-related problems in computer science and real-world applications.
