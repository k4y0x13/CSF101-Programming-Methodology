# Queue Data Structure

## Definition
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle. Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).

TODO: Add queue visualization

## Key Properties
1. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: The first element added is the first one to be removed.
2. **Two-ended**: Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
3. **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
4. **Dynamic Size**: Typically grows and shrinks as elements are enqueued and dequeued.

## Basic Operations
1. **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue
2. **Dequeue**: Remove and return the front element from the queue
3. **Front**: View the front element without removing it
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty
5. **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue

## Time Complexity
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Front: O(1)
- isEmpty: O(1)
- Size: O(1)

## Memory Usage
- Depends on the underlying implementation (array-based or linked list-based)
- Memory = (size of data type) * (number of elements)

## Advantages
1. Maintains order of insertion
2. Efficient insertion and deletion (constant time)
3. Useful for managing resources and scheduling
4. Supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing

## Disadvantages
1. Fixed size in array-based implementation (can be mitigated with circular queue)
2. Potential for queue overflow or underflow if not managed properly
3. No random access to elements

## Common Use Cases
1. Task scheduling in operating systems
2. Breadth-First Search algorithm in graphs
3. Print job spooling
4. Handling of requests on a single shared resource (e.g., CPU)
5. Buffering for data streams

## Real World Application

Queues are widely used in computer science and everyday life to manage processes where first-come, first-served order is important. Here are some practical applications:

1. Customer Service Systems

- **Call Centers**: Incoming calls are placed in a queue and answered in the order they were received.
- **Help Desk Ticketing**: Support requests are processed in the order they are submitted.

2. Transportation and Logistics

- **Traffic Management**: Vehicles at a traffic signal are served in the order they arrive.
- **Airline Boarding**: Passengers board the plane based on their order in the queue.
- **Shipping and Delivery**: Orders are processed and shipped based on their order in the queue.

3. Operating Systems

- **CPU Scheduling**: Processes waiting for CPU time are managed in a queue.
- **Print Spooling**: Print jobs are processed in the order they are received.
- **I/O Buffer Management**: Data is read from or written to devices in a queued order.

4. Networking

- **Routers and Switches**: Network packets are queued before being transmitted.
- **Web Servers**: HTTP requests are often processed in a FIFO manner.

5. Healthcare

- **Emergency Room Triage**: While not strictly FIFO due to severity considerations, queues help manage patient wait times.
- **Organ Donation Lists**: Patients waiting for organ transplants are often managed in a queue-like system.

6. Entertainment and Services

- **Ticket Sales**: Online queuing systems for high-demand event tickets.
- **Amusement Park Ride Lines**: Physical queues for managing ride access.
- **Streaming Services**: Video or audio buffers use queues to ensure smooth playback.

7. Manufacturing and Production

- **Assembly Lines**: Products move through stages of assembly in a queue-like manner.
- **Inventory Management**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method for perishable goods.

8. Software and Web Development

- **Task Scheduling**: Background jobs or tasks are often managed in queues.
- **Message Brokers**: Systems like RabbitMQ use queues to manage message passing between services.

9. Financial Systems

- **Transaction Processing**: Banking transactions are often processed in the order they are received.
- **Stock Market Orders**: Some types of stock market orders are processed in a FIFO manner.

10. Education

- **Course Waitlists**: Students are added to course waitlists in the order they apply.
- **Grading Systems**: Some professors grade assignments in the order they were submitted.

## Variations
1. **Circular Queue**: Efficient use of fixed-size array
2. **Double-ended Queue (Deque)**: Allows insertion and deletion at both ends
3. **Priority Queue**: Elements have associated priorities

## Implementation Approaches
1. **Array-based**: Uses a dynamic or circular array to store elements
2. **Linked List-based**: Uses a singly linked list with front and rear pointers

## Memory Techniques for Retention
1. **Visualization**: Imagine a line of people waiting for a bus - first in line is first to board
2. **Analogy**: Compare to a pipe where items enter one end and exit the other
3. **Acronym**: FIFE (First-In, First-Exit)
4. **Mnemonic**: "First to arrive, first to leave" (like at a bakery)

## Code Example (Python)

```python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.popleft()
        else:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")

    def front(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Usage example
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue("Task 1")
queue.enqueue("Task 2")
queue.enqueue("Task 3")

print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: Task 1
print(queue.front())    # Output: Task 2
print(queue.size())     # Output: 2
```

Remember: Implement and experiment with queues in your preferred programming language to reinforce your understanding!
