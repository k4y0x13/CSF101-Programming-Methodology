## Introduction

While Python doesn't have a built-in linked list data structure, we can use the `collections.deque` (double-ended queue) to achieve similar functionality. The `deque` is implemented as a doubly-linked list internally, making it efficient for insertions and deletions at both ends.

## Using collections.deque for Linked Structures

First, let's import the `deque` class from the `collections` module:

```python
from collections import deque
```

Now we can create a deque object, which we'll use to simulate various types of linked lists.

```python
# Create an empty deque
my_list = deque()

# Create a deque with initial values
my_list_with_values = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

## Singly Linked List-like Operations

Although `deque` is a doubly-linked list internally, we can use it to simulate singly linked list operations by only using methods that would be efficient for a singly linked list.

```python
def create_list():
    return deque()

def is_empty(lst):
    return len(lst) == 0

def insert_front(lst, item):
    lst.appendleft(item)

def insert_back(lst, item):
    lst.append(item)

def delete_front(lst):
    if not is_empty(lst):
        return lst.popleft()
    raise IndexError("Cannot delete from an empty list")

def print_list(lst):
    print(" -> ".join(map(str, lst)) + " -> None")

# Example usage
my_list = create_list()
insert_front(my_list, 3)
insert_front(my_list, 2)
insert_front(my_list, 1)
insert_back(my_list, 4)

print("Initial list:")
print_list(my_list)  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None

deleted_item = delete_front(my_list)
print(f"Deleted item from front: {deleted_item}")
print("List after deletion:")
print_list(my_list)  # Output: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None
```

## Doubly Linked List-like Operations

The `deque` class naturally supports doubly linked list operations, allowing efficient insertions and deletions at both ends.

```python
def delete_back(lst):
    if not is_empty(lst):
        return lst.pop()
    raise IndexError("Cannot delete from an empty list")

def get_first(lst):
    if not is_empty(lst):
        return lst[0]
    raise IndexError("List is empty")

def get_last(lst):
    if not is_empty(lst):
        return lst[-1]
    raise IndexError("List is empty")

# Example usage
my_list = create_list()
insert_back(my_list, 1)
insert_back(my_list, 2)
insert_back(my_list, 3)

print("Initial list:")
print_list(my_list)  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None

print(f"First element: {get_first(my_list)}")
print(f"Last element: {get_last(my_list)}")

deleted_item = delete_back(my_list)
print(f"Deleted item from back: {deleted_item}")
print("List after deletion:")
print_list(my_list)  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> None
```

## Circular Linked List-like Operations

We can simulate a circular linked list using a `deque` by implementing a custom rotation function.

```python
def rotate(lst, n):
    lst.rotate(n)

def print_circular(lst):
    if is_empty(lst):
        print("Empty circular list")
    else:
        print(" -> ".join(map(str, lst)) + " -> (back to start)")

# Example usage
circular_list = create_list()
insert_back(circular_list, 1)
insert_back(circular_list, 2)
insert_back(circular_list, 3)
insert_back(circular_list, 4)

print("Initial circular list:")
print_circular(circular_list)  # Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> (back to start)

rotate(circular_list, 1)  # Rotate right by 1
print("After rotating right by 1:")
print_circular(circular_list)  # Output: 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> (back to start)

rotate(circular_list, -2)  # Rotate left by 2
print("After rotating left by 2:")
print_circular(circular_list)  # Output: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> (back to start)
```

## Performance Considerations

Using `deque` for linked list-like operations offers several advantages:

1. O(1) time complexity for insertions and deletions at both ends.
2. O(n) time complexity for access by index.
3. Efficient memory usage, as it doesn't require separate node objects.

However, there are some limitations:

1. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list is O(n).
2. It doesn't provide direct access to "next" or "previous" elements like a custom linked list implementation would.

## Summary

1. Using `collections.deque` to implement linked list-like structures
2. Simulating singly linked list operations
   - Insertion at front and back
   - Deletion from front
   - Traversal
3. Implementing doubly linked list operations
   - Insertion and deletion at both ends
   - Accessing first and last elements
4. Simulating circular linked list behavior
   - Rotation operations
5. Performance considerations when using `deque` for linked structures

By using the built-in `deque` class, we can achieve many of the benefits of linked lists without having to implement the data structure from scratch. This approach is particularly useful when working with Python and need linked list-like functionality without the complexity of a custom implementation.
