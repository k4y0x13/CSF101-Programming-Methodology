## 1 Introduction to Storing Data

Data storage is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. It involves organizing and managing data in a way that allows for efficient access, modification, and retrieval. In Python, we have various options for storing data, ranging from simple variables to complex data structures.

### 1.1 Static vs Dynamic Data Structures

Data structures can be classified into two main categories: static and dynamic.

#### Static Data Structures

Static data structures have a fixed size that is determined at compile time. They cannot grow or shrink during runtime.

**Example: Python List with Fixed Size**

```python
# Creating a static-like list in Python
static_list = [None] * 5
print(static_list)  # Output: [None, None, None, None, None]

# Trying to add an element beyond the fixed size will raise an error
try:
    static_list[5] = 6
except IndexError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Output: Error: list assignment index out of range
```

#### Dynamic Data Structures

Dynamic data structures can grow or shrink in size during runtime, allowing for more flexible memory usage.

**Example: Python List as a Dynamic Data Structure**

```python
# Creating a dynamic list in Python
dynamic_list = []
print(dynamic_list)  # Output: []

# Adding elements dynamically
dynamic_list.append(1)
dynamic_list.append(2)
dynamic_list.append(3)
print(dynamic_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Removing elements
dynamic_list.pop()
print(dynamic_list)  # Output: [1, 2]
```

## 2 Elementary Data Structures

Elementary data structures are the building blocks for more complex data structures. They provide a way to organize and store data in a computer's memory.

### 2.1 Array and its Properties

An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. In Python, lists are often used to represent arrays.

**Properties of Arrays:**

1. Fixed size (in most programming languages, but not in Python)
2. Homogeneous elements (in most languages, but Python allows heterogeneous elements)
3. Contiguous memory allocation
4. Random access (constant time complexity for accessing elements)

**Example: Creating and Accessing Array Elements**

```python
# Creating an array (list in Python)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Accessing elements
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry

# Getting the length of the array
print(len(fruits))  # Output: 4

# Iterating through the array
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### 2.2 Array Operations and Methods

Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate lists (which serve as arrays in Python).

**Example: Common Array Operations**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Adding elements
numbers.append(6)  # Add to the end
numbers.insert(0, 0)  # Insert at a specific index
print(numbers)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Removing elements
numbers.pop()  # Remove and return the last element
removed = numbers.pop(0)  # Remove and return element at index 0
numbers.remove(3)  # Remove the first occurrence of 3
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]

# Updating elements
numbers[1] = 10
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 10, 4, 5]

# Searching for elements
index = numbers.index(4)
print(f"Index of 4: {index}")  # Output: Index of 4: 2

# Sorting
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 5, 10]

# Reversing
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 5, 4, 1]
```

### 2.3 Multi-dimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays. In Python, we can create multi-dimensional arrays using nested lists.

**Example: 2D Array (Matrix)**

```python
# Creating a 2D array (3x3 matrix)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Accessing elements
print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6 (row 1, column 2)

# Iterating through a 2D array
for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row

# Output:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9

# Modifying elements
matrix[0][0] = 10
print(matrix)  # Output: [[10, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Adding a new row
matrix.append([10, 11, 12])
print(matrix)  # Output: [[10, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

# Getting dimensions of the matrix
rows = len(matrix)
cols = len(matrix[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
print(f"Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")  # Output: Dimensions: 4x3
```

**Example: 3D Array**

```python
# Creating a 3D array (2x3x2)
cube = [
    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
    [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]
]

# Accessing elements
print(cube[1][1][0])  # Output: 9 (2nd layer, 2nd row, 1st column)

# Iterating through a 3D array
for layer in cube:
    for row in layer:
        for element in row:
            print(element, end=" ")
        print()  # New line after each row
    print()  # New line after each layer

# Output:
# 1 2
# 3 4
# 5 6

# 7 8
# 9 10
# 11 12

# Modifying elements
cube[0][0][0] = 100
print(cube)  # Output: [[[100, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]]
```

These examples demonstrate the basics of working with arrays and multi-dimensional arrays in Python.

Remember that **Python's lists are more flexible than traditional arrays in many programming languages,** allowing for dynamic sizing and heterogeneous elements.
