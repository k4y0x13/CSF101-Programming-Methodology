# Hash Table (Hash Map) Data Structure

## Definition
A Hash Table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Key Properties
1. **Key-Value Pairs**: Stores data as key-value pairs.
2. **Hash Function**: Uses a hash function to map keys to array indices.
3. **Collision Resolution**: Handles situations where different keys hash to the same index.
4. **Dynamic Sizing**: Can resize to maintain efficiency as the number of elements grows.
5. **Load Factor**: Ratio of occupied slots to total slots, affects performance.

## Basic Components
1. **Hash Function**: Converts keys into array indices.
2. **Array**: Stores the key-value pairs.
3. **Collision Resolution Method**: Handles multiple keys mapping to the same index.

## Basic Operations
1. **Insert**: Add a new key-value pair.
2. **Delete**: Remove a key-value pair.
3. **Search**: Find the value associated with a given key.
4. **Update**: Modify the value associated with a given key.

## Time Complexity
- Average Case (with a good hash function):
  - Insert: O(1)
  - Delete: O(1)
  - Search: O(1)
- Worst Case (many collisions):
  - All operations: O(n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n), where n is the number of key-value pairs stored

## Collision Resolution Techniques
1. **Chaining**: Each array index points to a linked list of entries.
2. **Open Addressing**:
   - Linear Probing: Check next slot sequentially.
   - Quadratic Probing: Check slots at quadratic intervals.
   - Double Hashing: Use a second hash function.

## Advantages
1. Fast average-case access, insertion, and deletion (O(1))
2. Flexible keys (can use strings, objects, etc. as keys)
3. Efficient for large datasets when properly tuned
4. Implements dictionary/map abstract data type

## Disadvantages
1. Poor worst-case performance
2. May require resizing, which is expensive
3. Not efficient for small datasets
4. No ordering of keys

## Common Use Cases
1. Database indexing
2. Caches (e.g., web browser cache)
3. Symbol tables in compilers
4. Spell checkers
5. Implementing associative arrays
6. Counting distinct elements

## Variations
1. **Bloom Filter**: Space-efficient probabilistic data structure
2. **Cuckoo Hashing**: Uses multiple hash functions for better worst-case performance
3. **Perfect Hashing**: Achieves O(1) worst-case lookup time for static sets

## Memory Techniques for Retention
1. **Visualization**: Imagine a library where books (values) are placed on shelves (array slots) based on a code (hash) derived from their titles (keys).
2. **Analogy**: Compare to a valet parking system where car placement is determined by a function of the license plate number.
3. **Acronym**: HASH (Hashed Array Stores Haplessly)
4. **Mnemonic**: "Key to index, value in place, constant time access, at lightning pace"

## Code Example (Python)

```python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self, size=10):
        self.size = size
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]

    def _hash(self, key):
        return hash(key) % self.size

    def insert(self, key, value):
        index = self._hash(key)
        for item in self.table[index]:
            if item[0] == key:
                item[1] = value
                return
        self.table[index].append([key, value])

    def get(self, key):
        index = self._hash(key)
        for item in self.table[index]:
            if item[0] == key:
                return item[1]
        raise KeyError(key)

    def remove(self, key):
        index = self._hash(key)
        for i, item in enumerate(self.table[index]):
            if item[0] == key:
                del self.table[index][i]
                return
        raise KeyError(key)

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.table)

# Usage example
ht = HashTable()
ht.insert("apple", 5)
ht.insert("banana", 7)
ht.insert("orange", 3)

print(ht.get("banana"))  # Output: 7
ht.remove("apple")
print(ht)  # Output: [[], [['banana', 7]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [['orange', 3]]]
```
