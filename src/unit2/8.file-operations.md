# File Operations

# Python File Operations

## File Input/Output and File Handling in Python

File operations are crucial for many programming tasks, allowing you to read from and write to files on your computer. Python provides powerful and easy-to-use functions for file handling.

## 1. File Input/Output

### Opening a File

To work with a file, you first need to open it. The `open()` function is used for this purpose.

Syntax:

```python
file = open(filename, mode)
```

- `filename`: the name or path of the file
- `mode`: specifies the purpose of opening the file (read, write, append, etc.)

Common modes:

- `'r'`: Read (default)
- `'w'`: Write (overwrites the file if it exists)
- `'a'`: Append (adds to the end of the file)
- `'x'`: Exclusive creation (fails if the file already exists)
- `'b'`: Binary mode
- `'t'`: Text mode (default)

Example:

```python
# Opening a file for reading
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Opening a file for writing
file = open('new_file.txt', 'w')
```

### Closing a File

It's important to close a file after you're done with it to free up system resources.

```python
file.close()
```

### Using `with` Statement

The `with` statement is recommended as it automatically closes the file after you're done:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # File operations here
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# File is automatically closed outside the with block
```

### Reading from a File

There are several methods to read from a file:

1. `read()`: Reads the entire file

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

2. `readline()`: Reads a single line

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    first_line = file.readline()
    print(first_line)
```

3. `readlines()`: Reads all lines into a list

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace
```

4. Iterating over the file object

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

### Writing to a File

1. `write()`: Writes a string to the file

```python
with open('new_file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")
```

2. `writelines()`: Writes a list of strings to the file

```python
lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"]
with open('new_file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

### Appending to a File

To add content to the end of an existing file, use the 'a' mode:

```python
with open('existing_file.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("\nThis line is appended.")
```

## 2. Text and Binary File Handling

### Text Files

Text files contain human-readable characters. When working with text files, Python handles line endings and character encoding.

Example: Reading and writing a CSV file

```python
import csv

# Writing to a CSV file
data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['Alice', '30', 'New York'],
    ['Bob', '25', 'Los Angeles']
]

with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)

# Reading from a CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(', '.join(row))
```

### Binary Files

Binary files contain data in binary format, which is not human-readable. They are used for non-text data like images, audio files, etc.

Example: Copying an image file

```python
# Copying a binary file (e.g., an image)
with open('original_image.jpg', 'rb') as source:
    with open('copy_image.jpg', 'wb') as dest:
        dest.write(source.read())
```

### Working with JSON Files

JSON is a popular data format. Python's `json` module makes it easy to work with JSON data.

```python
import json

# Writing JSON to a file
data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

# Reading JSON from a file
with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    loaded_data = json.load(file)
    print(loaded_data)
```

### File Pointer and Seeking

You can move the file pointer to different positions using `seek()`:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    file.seek(5)  # Move to the 6th byte in the file
    print(file.read(10))  # Read 10 characters from that position
```

### Error Handling in File Operations

It's good practice to use try-except blocks when working with files:

```python
try:
    with open('nonexistent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
except IOError:
    print("An error occurred while reading the file.")
```

### Working with Paths

The `os` and `pathlib` modules provide functions for working with file paths:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Using os
current_dir = os.getcwd()
file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'example.txt')

# Using pathlib
current_path = Path.cwd()
file_path = current_path / 'example.txt'

print(f"File exists: {file_path.exists()}")
```

### Temporary Files

For temporary file operations, you can use the `tempfile` module:

```python
import tempfile

with tempfile.TemporaryFile('w+t') as temp:
    temp.write('This is a temporary file')
    temp.seek(0)
    print(temp.read())
# File is automatically deleted after the with block
```

File operations are fundamental in many programming tasks. They allow you to persist data, read configurations, process large datasets, and much more. Understanding these concepts will greatly enhance your ability to work with files efficiently in Python.
