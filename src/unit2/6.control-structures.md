# Control Structures

# Python Control Structures

## Control Structures in Python

Control structures are programming constructs that allow you to control the flow of your program's execution. They enable you to make decisions, repeat actions, and organize your code into logical blocks.

## 1. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

### If-Else Statements

The if-else statement is the most common type of conditional statement.

Syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # code to execute if another_condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if all conditions are False
```

Examples:

1. Basic if-else:

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

# Output: You are an adult.
```

2. If-elif-else chain:

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")

# Output: Your grade is: B
```

3. Nested if statements:

```python
x = 10
y = 5

if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("Both x and y are positive.")
    else:
        print("x is positive, but y is not.")
else:
    print("x is not positive.")

# Output: Both x and y are positive.
```

4. Ternary operator (conditional expression):

```python
age = 20
status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"
print(status)

# Output: adult
```

### Switch-Case Equivalent in Python

Python doesn't have a built-in switch-case statement, but you can achieve similar functionality using dictionaries or if-elif chains.

Example using a dictionary:

```python
def switch_demo(argument):
    switcher = {
        1: "January",
        2: "February",
        3: "March",
        4: "April"
    }
    return switcher.get(argument, "Invalid month")

print(switch_demo(2))  # Output: February
print(switch_demo(5))  # Output: Invalid month
```

## 2. Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

### For Loops

For loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects.

Syntax:

```python
for item in iterable:
    # code to execute for each item
```

Examples:

1. Iterating over a list:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```

2. Using range():

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

3. Enumerating a list:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")

# Output:
# Index 0: apple
# Index 1: banana
# Index 2: cherry
```

4. Nested for loops:

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i*j}")
    print()  # Print a newline after each inner loop

# Output:
# 1 * 1 = 1
# 1 * 2 = 2
# 1 * 3 = 3

# 2 * 1 = 2
# 2 * 2 = 4
# 2 * 3 = 6

# 3 * 1 = 3
# 3 * 2 = 6
# 3 * 3 = 9
```

### While Loops

While loops execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # code to execute while condition is True
```

Examples:

1. Basic while loop:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

2. While loop with user input:

```python
user_input = ""
while user_input.lower() != "quit":
    user_input = input("Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): ")
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")

print("Program ended.")

# Sample run:
# Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): hello
# You entered: hello
# Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): python
# You entered: python
# Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): quit
# You entered: quit
# Program ended.
```

3. Infinite loop with a break condition:

```python
while True:
    number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if number <= 0:
        print("That's not a positive number. Try again.")
    else:
        print(f"You entered: {number}")
        break

print("Loop ended.")

# Sample run:
# Enter a positive number: -5
# That's not a positive number. Try again.
# Enter a positive number: 0
# That's not a positive number. Try again.
# Enter a positive number: 10
# You entered: 10
# Loop ended.
```

## 3. Break and Continue Statements

Break and continue statements allow you to control the flow of loops more precisely.

### Break Statement

The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.

Example:

```python
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number == 5:
        break
    print(number)

print("Loop ended")

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Loop ended
```

### Continue Statement

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.

Example:

```python
for number in range(1, 6):
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print(number)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5
```

### Using Break and Continue in While Loops

Example:

```python
count = 0
while True:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        continue
    if count == 5:
        break
    print(count)

print("Loop ended")

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 4
# Loop ended
```

### Else Clause in Loops

Python allows the use of else clauses with both for and while loops. The else block is executed when the loop condition becomes false.

Example with for loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed normally")

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Loop completed normally
```

Example with while loop and break:

```python
n = 0
while n < 5:
    if n == 3:
        break
    print(n)
    n += 1
else:
    print("Loop completed normally")

print("Outside the loop")

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# Outside the loop
```

Note that in the second example, the else block is not executed because the loop was terminated by a break statement.

These control structures form the backbone of program flow in Python. Understanding and effectively using them will greatly enhance your ability to write complex and efficient Python programs. Remember to practice these concepts with your own examples to reinforce your learning!
