## 1. Introduction to Flowcharts

Flowcharts are **graphical representations of algorithms**, workflows, or processes.

They use standardized symbols to illustrate the steps and decision points in a process, making it easier to visualize and understand complex procedures.

## 2. Key Principles of Flowcharts

### 2.1 Clarity and Readability

Flowcharts should be easy to follow and understand, even for those not familiar with the specific process being described.

### 2.2 Consistency

Use standardized symbols and follow consistent conventions throughout the flowchart.

### 2.3 Simplicity

Break down complex processes into simpler steps, using sub-processes where necessary to maintain clarity.

## 3. Standard Flowchart Symbols and Their Meanings

### 3.1 Oval (Terminal)

- Represents the start or end of a program or process.
- Typically contains "Start" or "End" text.
- Indicates the entry and exit points of a flowchart.

### 3.2 Arrow (Flow Line)

- Shows the direction of process flow.
- Connects different elements of the flowchart.
- Indicates the sequence of operations.

### 3.3 Parallelogram (Input/Output)

- Represents input or output operations.
- Used for displaying data entry or results.
- Can indicate manual input, printed output, or displayed information.

### 3.4 Rectangle (Process)

- Represents a processing step or action.
- Indicates any operation where data is manipulated or changed.
- Can represent calculations, data transformations, or function calls.

### 3.5 Diamond (Decision)

- Represents a decision point or branching in the process.
- Contains a question or condition that can be answered with "Yes" or "No" (True or False).
- Has two outgoing arrows, typically labeled with the possible outcomes.
